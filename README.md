Total-Linux-Hardening
=========

Ansible role for Linux hardening on (currently) supported systems and for now, it is tested on:
- CentOS 6, 7, 8
- RedHat 6, 7, 8
- SLES_SAP (SLES) 12, 15

The role is created with some recommendations from CIS, Red Hat, Lynis, and my own. Testing is done only on minimal server installations, so please use role with caution and always have system backup when you run it. Please, do not run role on production servers, there are much of works with software packages, firewall setup, file system, and partition changes and other sensitive parts of systems and there will be reboots - so, run only after test on testing servers (like you already do, I hope :-)
Supported file systems for partition hardening: ext3, ext4, xfs.

Some of the dangerous tasks from the role, worth to mention:
- Kernel hardening
- GRUB changes (like the setup of single-user password)
- File system changes for many partitions (like /home, /proc, /boot, etc) with the new mount options
- Disabling of many file systems, like fat32, vfat...
- Firewall will be configured to allow only ping and ssh
- Forget simple passwords and root will not be able to log in anymore
- New umask values
- Permissions will be changed on many sensitive files and folders
- Many system users will be removed from the system or their shell will be changed
- Removal of httpd, NFS, dovecot, NTP , smb, xinetd, vsftpd, FTP, etc...
- Many services will be disabled, like cups, smb, xinetd, anacron, NFS...
- Removal and disable of bash history
- Setup of session timeout
- Regular user will not be allowed to see processes other than own 
- SSH hardening (and by default SSH port will be changed to 2222)
- Banners will be configured, old ones will be removed 

Also, there are much work for manual steps, like required partitions are missing - you will need manually to fix that or to reinstall machine and start from the scratch, so please check Ansible output.

What is missing
=========
- AppArmor setup for SLES
- Test on SLE 12 and SLE 15 (I am sure it will work as usual, but I didn't test it. I did tests on SLES for SAP Applications)


Requirements
------------

Ansible server:
- Ansible 2.7+

Target machine(s):
- SSH connection with the sudo access.
- SUSE and RHEL: Python (SUSE minimal doesn't have it)
- RHEL: libselinux-python (for SELinux config on RHEL)
- SUSE: python-xml, 
- Machine connected to a package repository source

Role Variables
--------------

File: defaults/main.yml
  - Setup rsyslog port (default: 514)
  - Setup SSH port (default: 2222)
  - Disable bash history? (default: true)
  - Setup session timeout (default: 900)
  - Do system needs use GUI (default: false)

  - Do system use external OSSEC server (default: false)
  - Chose do you want to install AIDE (default: true)
  - Server can be rebooted? (default: true)
  - selinux: "enforcing"         
  - selinux_policy: "targeted"

There are some hardcoded files, like versions of OSSEC, Lynis, rkhunter - please check content of /files.
